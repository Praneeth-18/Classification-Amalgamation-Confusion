# Classification-Amalgamation-Confusion

### Objective:

The task is to perform classification to see if carpooling is possible or not for a given ride. The criteria being pickup and dropoff locations of rides are similar within certain range.

We achieve this by performing groupby on pickup_longitude, pickup_latitude, dropoff_longitude and dropoff_latitude.
